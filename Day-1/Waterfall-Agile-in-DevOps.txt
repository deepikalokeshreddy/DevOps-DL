Waterfall vs Agile in DevOps

1. Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall is a linear, sequential development model.

✔ Characteristics

Fixed phases: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

Each phase must be completed before the next begins

Extensive documentation

Agile Methodology

Agile is iterative, flexible, and highly collaborative.

✔ Characteristics

Development happens in short sprints

Continuous feedback and iterative improvement

Requirements can evolve

Emphasizes working software over documentation

What is the difference between Waterfall and Agile methodology in DevOps?”

Answer:
In a DevOps environment, Agile aligns much better than Waterfall because DevOps focuses on continuous integration, continuous delivery, and rapid feedback loops. Waterfall is a linear, phase-driven model where development, testing, and deployment happen sequentially. This makes it harder to implement DevOps practices like automated testing or continuous deployments because each phase is rigidly separated and release cycles are long.

Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and encourages continuous collaboration between cross-functional teams. These short, frequent sprints align directly with DevOps objectives. Agile teams deliver small increments of code frequently, which fits perfectly with DevOps CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and continuous monitoring.
